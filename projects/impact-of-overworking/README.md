# Impact of Overworking on Productivity

**Goal:**  
Investigate the relationship between excessive working hours, employee health, and labor productivity across countries.  

**Methods & Tools:**  
- Data sources: OECD (working hours), ILO (global labor stats), BLS (U.S. labor productivity)  
- Tools: Regression analysis in R, visualization in Excel and PowerPoint  
- Variables: Average weekly working hours, hourly compensation, output per worker, labor costs, value-added output  

**Key Insights:**  
- Working more than **55 hours per week increases stroke risk by 33%** (WHO/ILO).  
- OECD data showed that **countries with longer working hours had lower productivity per hour**.  
- Regression results suggested a **negative relationship** between average weekly working hours and labor productivity.  
- Highlighted real-world implications: burnout, quiet quitting, and rising labor costs.  

**Solutions Proposed:**  
- Encourage automation and efficiency improvements  
- Adjust overtime pay policies  
- Promote workâ€“life balance to sustain productivity
