# TMBA Quant Trading Track (In Progress)

**Goal:**  
Explore quantitative trading strategies as part of the TMBA program, focusing on feature engineering, risk management, and backtesting.  

**Methods & Tools:**  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Strategy components: Bollinger Bands, RSI, Moving Averages, ATR-based stop loss  
- Capital allocation and position sizing simulations  

**Key Learnings So Far:**  
- Built preliminary scripts for feature extraction and position sizing.  
- Explored ensemble scoring rules (e.g., requiring multiple technical indicators to align).  
- Implemented backtesting logic with transaction cost adjustments.  

**Preliminary Results:**  
- Backtesting simulations on Taiwan index futures (TXF) indicated a **hypothetical return of +138%** over the test period.  
- Performance was achieved under strict shorting rules, ATR-based stop losses, and capital allocation constraints.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These results are based on **historical simulations** and do not represent live trading performance.  

**Status:**  
This project is a **work in progress**. While not a finished trading system, it reflects my ongoing learning in applying Python to financial data and developing systematic trading ideas.
